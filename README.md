It's more fun to make tools than to write blog entries. Or at least just as fun. So here is a tool that I wrote to help me write blog entries, hah!

## Goals

* Practice typescript
* Practice typescript as a scripting language (CLI, external execution)
* Encourage myself to write blog entries :)
* Avoid working on blog entries by messing with this

## Usage:

I have `blog.ts` symlinked as `$HOME/bin/blog`.
